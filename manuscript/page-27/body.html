There is also a variety of squirrel that carries 24 chromosomes. The <em>peromyscus</em> and <em>apodemus</em> families of mice—and some other animals, including the rhesus monkey—have 48—cousins whose chromosome doubling eons ago started them up different paths from ours. Mr. Truggles, the ancestor of man was a rodent whose doubled chromosomes gave him new attributes that worked to his evolutionary advantage."</p><p>"Is that what is called a mutation?" asked Truggles, interested in spite of himself.</p><p>"Mutation? A mutation is a change in one gene. Men mutate every day. How many millions upon millions of years do you think it would take simple mutations to build a man from a rodent—or a lemur, either, for that matter?"</p></div> </div>
